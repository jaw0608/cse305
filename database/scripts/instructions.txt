First, be sure to have mysql and mysql-workbench installed.

Open mysql using the following:

mysql -u root -p

You will be asked to enter your root password.

Next, create a new database called data:

CREATE DATABASE data;

Now, open MYSQL workbench and connect to the local instance.
Open the 'createTables.sql' script and execute it using the lightning symbol.
Now that the table are created, do the same with 'insertValues.sql' to insert mock data.
